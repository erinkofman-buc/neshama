**Subject:** Free community resource for your congregation — Neshama.ca

Dear [Rabbi/Synagogue Administrator name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Erin Kofman, and I am writing to share a free community resource I have built called **Neshama** (neshama.ca).

**What Neshama does:**

Neshama is a free website designed to support Jewish families in Toronto and Montreal when they experience a loss. It provides:

1. **An obituary feed** — Listings from Steeles Memorial Chapel, Benjamin's Park Memorial Chapel, and Paperman & Sons, all in one searchable place.

2. **A meal coordination tool** — When a family is sitting shiva, friends and community members can sign up to bring food on specific days. The page shows what's already covered and what's still needed — eliminating the back-and-forth of phone calls and WhatsApp messages.

3. **A caterer directory** — Local food vendors who provide shiva meals, making it easy for families and supporters to find and order food.

**Everything is free.** No accounts, no fees, no advertisements. Neshama is a community resource, not a business.

**Why I'm writing to you:**

I believe Neshama could be a valuable resource for your congregation. If you find it helpful, I would be grateful if you would consider:
- Sharing it in your synagogue newsletter or weekly email
- Mentioning it to your chesed committee
- Adding it to your list of community resources

You can visit the site at **neshama.ca**. The meal coordination tool is at neshama.ca/shiva/organize.

I would welcome any feedback, questions, or suggestions. I built Neshama to serve our community, and your input would help me make it better.

With warm regards,
Erin Kofman
