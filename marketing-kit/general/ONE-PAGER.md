## What is Neshama?

**Neshama** (neshama.ca) is a free resource for Jewish families in Toronto and Montreal when someone passes away.

Neshama means "soul" in Hebrew — the divine spark within each person.

## What it does

**1. Obituary Feed**
Listings from Steeles Memorial Chapel, Benjamin's Park Memorial Chapel, and Paperman & Sons — all in one place. No more checking three websites.

**2. Meal Coordination**
Families set up a page. Volunteers sign up to bring food on specific days. Everyone sees what's covered and what's still needed. No more 47 WhatsApp messages.

**3. Caterer Directory**
Local food vendors who do shiva meals. Browse, compare, order.

## What it costs

Nothing. Free. No accounts, no fees, no ads.

## Who built it

Erin Kofman — a pharmacist in Toronto who saw how hard it is for families to coordinate support during a loss, and built a tool to help.

## How to use it
