## MESSAGE 1: From Erin to Montreal friend

Hey [Name],

I built something I think Montreal's Jewish community would really find useful and I want you to be one of the first to see it.

It's called Neshama (neshama.ca) — a free resource for Jewish families dealing with a loss. It pulls together obituaries from Paperman & Sons (and Toronto funeral homes too), has a meal coordination tool so people can sign up to bring food on specific days, and a caterer directory.

It's free. No sign-up, no fees. I started with Toronto and Montreal because they're the two biggest Jewish communities in Canada, and Paperman's is such a cornerstone of Montreal's community.

Would you take a look and tell me what you think? And if you think it's useful — sharing it in even one Montreal WhatsApp group would mean the world to me.

## MESSAGE 2: For Montreal friend to forward into WhatsApp groups

Hi everyone — sharing a free resource that I think our community will really find useful.

It's called Neshama (neshama.ca) — a site that pulls together obituary listings from Paperman & Sons and other funeral homes, plus tools for coordinating shiva meals and finding caterers.

It does three things:
1. Obituary feed — Paperman's listings plus Toronto funeral homes, all in one place
2. Meal coordination — families set up a page, volunteers sign up for which day to bring food
3. Caterer directory — local food vendors who do shiva meals

Completely free. No sign-up, no fees, no ads.

Built by a member of the Toronto Jewish community, with Montreal included from day one because Paperman's is such an important part of our community.

Worth bookmarking: neshama.ca

## MESSAGE 4: For friends with FAMILY in Montreal (Toronto-based friends)

Hey [Name] — I know you have family in Montreal. I built a site called neshama.ca that covers obituaries from Paperman & Sons in Montreal (plus Toronto funeral homes). Free meal coordination tool and caterer directory too. Might be useful for your family to know about. Would you share it with them?
