## MESSAGE 1: From Erin to Jordana (send first)

Hey Jordana,

I need to tell you about something I've been building. You know how when someone passes away, everyone's checking different funeral home websites, and then the WhatsApp chain starts — "who's bringing food Tuesday?" "did someone already sign up for Wednesday?" "does anyone know a caterer who delivers?"

I built a site that fixes all of that. It's called Neshama (neshama.ca).

It does three things:
- Pulls obituaries from Steeles, Benjamin's, and Paperman's into one feed
- Has a meal coordination tool where people sign up for which day they're bringing food
- A directory of 18 caterers who do shiva meals

It's free. No sign-up, no fees, no ads. I just want our community to use it.

I'm going live with it and you're the first person I'm telling because honestly — you're the person who's going to make this work. Your network is everything.

Would you look at it and then share it in a few of your groups? I've got a message below you can forward, or you can say it however feels right to you.

## MESSAGE 2: For Jordana to forward into WhatsApp groups (copy-paste ready)

Hi everyone — a friend of mine built something really useful that I want to share.

It's called Neshama (neshama.ca) — a free resource for Jewish families in Toronto and Montreal when someone passes away.

Three things it does:
1. Obituary feed — Steeles, Benjamin's, and Paperman's all in one place
2. Meal coordination — sign up to bring food on specific days, no more duplicate kugels on Tuesday and nothing on Thursday
3. Caterer directory — local vendors who do shiva meals

It's completely free. No accounts, no fees.

This is the kind of thing that's most useful when you know about it before you need it. Bookmark it or share it with someone who would find it helpful.

## MESSAGE 3: Shorter version for Jordana's smaller / closer groups

Hey — quick share. A friend built neshama.ca — free site that has all the Toronto and Montreal Jewish obituaries in one place + a tool to coordinate shiva meals. Really well done. Worth bookmarking.

## MESSAGE 4: For Jordana to send to individual friends

Have you seen neshama.ca? My friend Erin built it — it's a free site for our community. Has obituaries from all the funeral homes in one place, plus a meal coordination tool for shiva. Really useful. Check it out when you get a chance.

## TALKING POINTS (if Jordana gets questions)

**"Is it really free?"**
Yes. No accounts, no fees, no ads. Erin built it as a community resource.

**"Who built this?"**
Erin Kofman — she's a pharmacist in Toronto. She built it because she saw how hard it is for families to coordinate everything when someone passes.

**"Is it only Orthodox / only kosher?"**
No — it serves the entire Jewish community. All denominations. The caterer directory has all types of food.

**"Why Toronto and Montreal?"**
Those are the two largest Jewish communities in Canada. She started with the funeral homes that serve them.

**"Can I add my caterer / food business?"**
Yes — email contact@neshama.ca.

**"Is it safe / legit?"**
Yes. All obituary data comes directly from the funeral home websites. No personal data is collected. No accounts needed.
