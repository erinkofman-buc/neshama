# Neshama - Next Sprint TODO

## UX Fixes
- [ ] Premium page looks juvenile - needs design overhaul
- [ ] Premium should redirect to landing page (remove or rethink)
- [ ] Consider donation model instead of subscription

## Shiva Support Enhancements
- [ ] Print/download shiva meal schedule
- [ ] Permission-based editing for family members
- [ ] Design audit - rate against top industry standards
- [ ] How families discover/share the shiva page (distribution UX)

## Do NOT build anything else tonight.
