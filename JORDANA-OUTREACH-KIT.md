## 1. Quick Intro Message (WhatsApp / Text)

Copy and send as-is. Works for friends, family, WhatsApp groups, or anyone you'd normally text.

Hey! My friend Erin built something really thoughtful for our community and I wanted to share it with you. It's called Neshama (www.neshama.co) — a free site for Jewish families dealing with a loss. You can find obituaries from local funeral homes, coordinate shiva meals so nothing overlaps, and browse a directory of 110+ caterers and vendors. Worth bookmarking for when you or someone you know might need it.

## 2. Longer Email Version

For people who want more detail — a rabbi, a chesed committee chair, a community leader, or anyone who asks "tell me more." Still warm, still personal.

**Subject line:** A community resource I wanted you to know about

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something with you that I think could be really valuable for our community.

My friend Erin Kofman built a free resource called Neshama (www.neshama.co) for Jewish families in Montreal and Toronto. When someone passes away, the people around them want to help — but the logistics can be overwhelming, especially for the family. Neshama brings everything together in one place.

Here's what it does:

**Obituary Feed** — Aggregates listings from local funeral homes (Paperman's, Steeles, Benjamin's) so you can stay informed without checking multiple sites. There are already 109+ real listings.

**Meal Coordination** — Families or friends can set up a page where volunteers sign up to bring food on specific days. Everyone can see what's covered and what's still needed — no more duplicate kugels on Tuesday and nothing on Thursday. There's a clear step-by-step walkthrough right on the page so it's easy to set up even if you've never done it before.

**Vendor Directory** — 110+ verified caterers, bakeries, gift basket companies, and comfort food vendors across Montreal and Toronto. You can browse by category and find exactly what you need.

**Condolence Guestbook** — Friends and community members can leave tributes, light a memorial candle, or share a memory. The family gets a beautiful keepsake.

Everything is completely free. No sign-up required, no fees, no paywall. Erin built this as a passion project because she saw how hard it is for families to manage logistics during the hardest week of their lives.

I'd love for you to take a look: www.neshama.co

And if you think it would be useful for people you know — your shul, your chesed committee, your community groups — please share it. It's the kind of resource that's most helpful when people know about it before they need it.

Warmly,
Jordana

## 3. FAQ / Objection Handling

When people ask questions, here's what to say. Keep it conversational — you're not selling anything.

### "What is this exactly?"

> It's a free website for Jewish families when someone passes away. It pulls together obituaries from funeral homes in one place, has a tool to coordinate who's bringing meals on which days during shiva, and has a directory of local caterers and vendors. Think of it as a community resource — everything a family or their friends might need during that first week, all in one spot.

### "Why not just call a caterer?"

> You absolutely can — and the site actually has a directory of 110+ caterers to help you find one. But the coordination piece is different. When someone is sitting shiva, it's not just one person helping — it's a dozen friends all wanting to bring food. Without coordination, you get three trays of lasagna on Tuesday and nothing on Thursday. The meal tool lets everyone see what days are covered and sign up for a specific slot. It works alongside calling a caterer, not instead of it.

### "Is this only for Jewish families?"

> It was designed with the Jewish community in mind — shiva, yahrzeit, the traditions around mourning. The obituaries come from Jewish funeral homes and the vendors serve shiva families. But anyone is welcome to use it. There's nothing that locks it to one group.

### "Does it cost anything?"

> No. It's completely free for families. No accounts, no fees, no premium tier. Erin built it as a community resource. She's not trying to make money off grief — the site sustains itself through optional vendor listings, not from families.

### "How do I use it if someone I know is sitting shiva?"

> Go to www.neshama.co. You can:
> - Check the obituary feed to find the listing
> - If a meal coordination page has been set up, sign up to bring food on a specific day
> - Browse the vendor directory if you want to send a meal, gift basket, or something from a caterer
> - Leave a condolence message in the guestbook
>
> If no one has set up a meal coordination page yet, you can be the one to do it — there's a simple walkthrough on the site. You don't need to be family to organize.

## 4. What to Ask Testers

After someone has spent a few minutes on the site, ask them these five questions. Text or voice — whatever is natural. Write down what they say (even a few words) and send it to Erin.

1. **When you first landed on the site, was it clear what Neshama is and what it does?** (Did you get it within a few seconds, or were you confused at first?)

2. **Did you try the meal coordination page? Was it obvious how to set one up or sign up to bring food?** (If not, what was confusing?)

3. **Was there anything on the site that felt off-tone — too salesy, too clinical, or not right for a grieving family?** (Be honest. This matters a lot.)

4. **If someone you knew passed away tomorrow, would you actually use this site? Why or why not?**

5. **Is there anything missing that you'd want to see?** (A feature, a vendor, a piece of information — anything.)

## Notes for Jordana

- **The site is live and real.** 109 obituaries, 110 vendors, 24 pages — this is not a prototype.
- **All the beta feedback has been addressed.** The mobile UX was overhauled based on what Jennifer, Alana, and others said. Features are now above the fold, the meal coordination flow has a clear "How It Works" explainer, there's a "Why coordinate?" section, condolences now show confirmation feedback, and the obituary list is browsable (no need to spell names correctly).
- **Erin is not asking people to pay for anything.** This is about getting honest feedback and spreading awareness before families actually need it.
- **Tone matters.** This is about loss. Keep it warm, keep it real, keep it human. If something feels like a sales pitch, pull back.
- **Send feedback to Erin directly.** Even small things — "the font was hard to read on my phone" or "I didn't know what to click" — all of it helps.
